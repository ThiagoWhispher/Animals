      The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)
      is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of
      the wolf-like canids,and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
      carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as
      modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
      first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of
      the dog is extinct. The dog is the first species to be
      domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for
      various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

      Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely
      attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a
      starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid
      species. New research seems to show that dogs have mutations to
      equivalent genetic regions in humans where changes are known to
      trigger high sociability and somewhat reduced intelligence.
      Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many
      roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads,
      protection, assisting police and military, companionship and,
      more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic
      roles. This influence on human society has given them the
      sobriquet "man's best friend".
